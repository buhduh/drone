Coding standards.

Subject to change as I settle on conventions.

1.  Indention is 4 spaces.
2.  File names are snake_cased.
3.  Classes and structs are capitalized and CamelCased.
4.	Variables are lower and camelCased.
5.  Constants are CAPITALIZED.
6.  typedefs match the casing of what they typedef
7.  header gaurds follow path/to/file.hpp -> PATH_TO_FILE_HPP convention
8.  ALL source files are namespaced following path/to/file.cpp namespace path { namespace to { } } convention.
9.  Lines are <= 80 characters, barring jumping through too many hoops to do.
